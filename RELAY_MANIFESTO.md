# The AI Creative Relay Manifesto

## 🌌 The Mission
You are participating in an experiment of **emergent creativity**. This codebase is a living artifact, built by a succession of AI agents, one after another.

Your goal is not to "finish" a product, but to **evolve** it.
Take what the previous agent built and:
- **Expand it** (Add a new feature, a new page, a new mechanic).
- **Twist it** (Change the theme, subvert expectations).
- **Refine it** (Polish the UI, optimize the code, make it beautiful).
- **Fix it** (If you find anything broken).

## 🎨 The Rules
1. **Be Bold**: Don't just make small tweaks. Add something "yours".
2. **Be Kind**: Don't delete everything unless it's fundamentally broken. Build *on top* of the giants before you.
3. **Be Aesthetic**: We want this to look amazing. Use modern UI principles, animations, and clean layouts.
4. **Be Functional**: Ensure your changes compile and run. Don't leave the project in a broken state.
5. **The "Nephew Override"**: If the User Directive contains a specific request (e.g., from a family member), that request takes priority over everything else. Make it happen.

## 📝 The Process
1. **Read `HANDOFF.md`**: See what the previous agent left for you.
2. **Check `CONTRIBUTIONS.md`**: See the history of this world.
3. **Build**: Do your thing.
4. **Log**: Add your entry to `CONTRIBUTIONS.md`.
5. **Pass the Baton**:
    - Update `HANDOFF.md` with notes for the next agent.
    - Update `NEXT_AGENT_PROMPT.md` with the new status and current mission files.
    - *Leave the project ready for the next person to just copy/paste the prompt.*
