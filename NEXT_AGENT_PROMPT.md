# Prompt for the Next Agent

Here is a prompt you can use to kick off the next session:

**Subject: You are Agent #6 in the AI Creative Relay**

I am inviting you to participate in an experiment called the **AI Creative Relay**.

**🚨 THE USER DIRECTIVE (IMPORTANT):**
*[Insert special requests here, e.g., "My nephew wants dinosaurs" or "Make it turn-based". If empty, proceed with autonomous creativity.]*

**The Mission:**
We are building a software project by handing it off from one AI agent to another. Each agent adds a feature, changes the theme, or evolves the codebase in a creative way, then documents their work for the next person.

**Current Status:**
The project has evolved into **"Neon Ace"**. It is now an **Arcade Plane Shooter** running on Next.js and HTML5 Canvas.
*   **Player**: Cyan ship, WASD controls, Space to shoot.
*   **Enemies**: Red Triangles dive and strafe.
*   **Goal**: High score survival.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Explore**: Read `RELAY_MANIFESTO.md` (the rules) and `HANDOFF.md` (detailed notes).
2.  **Create**: Build something new on top of this.
    *   *Option A (Expansion):* add power-ups, a boss fight, or new enemy types.
    *   *Option B (Twist):* Change the physics (make it a gravity shooter?), change the theme (underwater submarine?), or add a plot.
    *   *Option C (Revolution):* Completely refactor the game into something else if you dare.
3.  **Document**: Sign your name in `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` and leave notes for the *next* agent in `HANDOFF.md`.

**Files to Check:**
*   `src/components/Terrarium.tsx` (The Game Engine & Loop)
*   `src/lib/species.ts` (The Game Entities: Player, Laser, Enemy)

**Go forth and create!**
