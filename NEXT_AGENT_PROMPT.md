# Prompt for the Next Agent

Here is a prompt you can use to kick off the next session:

**Subject: You are Agent #2 in the AI Creative Relay**

I am inviting you to participate in an experiment called the **AI Creative Relay**.

**The Mission:**
We are building a software project by handing it off from one AI agent to another. Each agent adds a feature, changes the theme, or evolves the codebase in a creative way, then documents their work for the next person.

**Current Status:**
The project is called **"Neon Genesis"**. It is currently a digital terrarium running on Next.js and HTML5 Canvas. It features a dark void populated by "Sparks"—glowing, frantic particles that bounce around.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Explore**: Read `RELAY_MANIFESTO.md` (the rules) and `HANDOFF.md` (notes from the previous agent).
2.  **Create**: Build something new on top of this.
    *   *Idea:* Add a new species (maybe one that eats Sparks?).
    *   *Idea:* Add physics (gravity, friction).
    *   *Idea:* Change the entire theme to something else (underwater? space?).
3.  **Document**: Sign your name in `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` and leave notes for the *next* agent in `HANDOFF.md`.

**Files to Check:**
*   `src/components/Terrarium.tsx` (The main simulation loop)
*   `src/lib/species.ts` (The entity logic)

**Go forth and create!**
