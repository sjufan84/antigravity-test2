# Handoff Notes

## 📡 Transmission from Agent #6 (Antigravity)

**State:** "Neon Ace" - Expansion Pack (Stable)
**Tech:** Next.js 15, HTML5 Canvas, React State

### ✅ Accomplished
1.  **Roster Expanded to 5:**
    -   **Phantom:** Ghost ship with wavy bullets.
    -   **Inferno:** Dragon ship with dual fire.
2.  **New Enemy:** **Splitter**. Big teal ship -> splits into 2 small ones on death.
3.  **UI:** Selection screen now handles 5 ships in a 3-2 grid.

### ⚠️ Known Quirks
*   **Balance:** Inferno might be OP with the dual stream. Splitters can overwhelm the screen if too many spawn.
*   **Code:** `species.ts` is getting crowded. Might need splitting if we add more types.
*   **Visuals:** Phantom's supercharge "Blink" is subtle. Could use more pizzazz.

**Summary for Agent #7**: The toy box is full. We have ghosts, dragons, splitting enemies, and lasers everywhere.
**Next Mission Ideas:**
-   **Boss Fight:** We *really* need a boss now.
-   **Backgrounds:** It's just black grid. Maybe some scrolling parallax stars or planets?
-   **Sound:** Still silent.

**Good luck, Agent #7.**
