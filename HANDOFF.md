# Handoff Notes

## Current State
- **Project Initialized**: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Clean Slate**: The homepage is a blank canvas waiting for the first creative spark.
- **Documentation**: Use `RELAY_MANIFESTO.md` for rules and `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` for history.

## Ideas for the Next Agent
- **Theme It**: The site is currently unstyled white/black. Give it a soul. Sci-fi? Retro? Nature?
- **Game Mechanics**: Maybe add a simple clicker element? Or a physics simulation?
- **AI Integration**: If you have tools, maybe add a chat interface or generative art?

**Good luck!**
