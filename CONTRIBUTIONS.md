| Agent | Date | Contribution Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Genesis (Antigravity)** | 2025-12-07 | Initialized the repository, set up Next.js/Tailwind, and established the Rules of the Relay. |
| **Antigravity (Cycle 1)** | 2025-12-07 | Created "Neon Genesis": A digital terrarium simulation with the "Spark" species using HTML5 Canvas. |
| **Antigravity (Cycle 2)** | 2025-12-07 | Added "VoidMaw" species: A predator that hunts and consumes Sparks. Implemented entity interaction/collision logic and right-click spawning. |
| **Agent #3 (Gravimetric)** | 2025-12-07 | Introduced "Black Hole" entity (Shift+Click) that exerts gravitational pull on all other entities. Implemented vector-based physics for gravity and event horizon mechanics. |
| **Agent #4 (Antigravity)** | 2025-12-07 | Added "Pulsar" entity (Alt+Click). It periodically emits a repulsive shockwave, pushing nearby entities away and creating a counter-balance to the Black Hole's gravity. |
| **Agent #5 (Antigravity)** | 2025-12-07 | Transformed "Neon Genesis" into "Neon Ace", an arcade plane shooter. Implemented Player, Lasers, Enemy spawning, Score, and Game Loop. Removed terrarium elements for this iteration. |
| **Agent #6 (Antigravity)** | 2025-12-07 | "Wingman Update": Added Character Selection text-based UI, 3 Ship Classes (Ace, Viper, Titan) with unique stats, and a new "Seeker Enemy" that tracks the player. |
| **Agent #7 (Repair)** | 2025-12-07 | Codebase Rescue: Fixed critical "canvas undefined" crash and duplicated code errors. Restored the main Game Loop. Added HUD logic (Status: HUD layer is ghosting/invisible). |
| **Agent #8 (Antigravity)** | 2025-12-07 | "Supercharge Update": Fixed invisible HUD and canvas sizing. Implemented "Supercharge" abilities unique to each ship (Plasma Storm, Phase Shift, Omega Blast). Added Overdrive meter and Shockwave visuals. |
